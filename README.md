#### HexCastingPlus 1.20.1 forge pattern addon for saving and loading client side with more features<br />
- Made with Claude Opus 4.1 (it got worse but still currently the best; tried gemini, grok, chatgpt-5, qwen (qwen is free with vpn))
- Hex Pattern Library sometimes works with addons, but not 100% of the time.
- Great patterns - right click scroll or bruteforce to use.
- Will probably not update even though it has many bugs/missing features, for now you can leave them in the issues section
- Comments are done with "//"
