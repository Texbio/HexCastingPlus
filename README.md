HexCastingPlus 1.20.1 forge pattern addon for saving and loading client side with more features 

- Made with Claude Opus 4.1 (it got significantly worse and can no longer recommend it https://llm-stats.com/)

- Hex Pattern Library doesn't currently have addon support (patterns will still save and load).

- Great patterns need to be bruteforced before they can be used or drawn and pasted in the file, then relaunch game (will fix if I ever work on the project again)

- Will probably not update even though it has many bugs/missing features, for now you can leave them in the issues section

Tips
- Holding shift while editing shows pattern name
- Holding shift while scrolling scrolls faster
