#### HexCastingPlus 1.20.1 forge pattern addon for saving and loading client side with more features<br />
- Made with Claude Opus 4.1 (it got worse but still currently the best; tried gemini, grok, chatgpt-5, qwen (qwen is free with vpn))
- Hex Pattern Library sometimes works with addons, but not 100% of the time.
- Great patterns - right click scroll or bruteforce to use.
- Comments are done with "//"
- Still has some visual bugs, sometimes I fix them when adding new stuff
